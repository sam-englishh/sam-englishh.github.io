About Me:

My name is Sam and I am learning how to code with R and this is my first website! I am majoring in Economics and planning to minor in Data Science at Pomona College. I enjoy working with numbers and data to explain my reasoning and love learning about different ways to present data. Have a look at the data visualizations I made on my website :)

About This Website:

This website contains projects that I was tasked to do as a part of my introductory data science course at Pomona College, taught by Johanna Hardin. Also on this website is a presentation that I made to explain the visualizations that I made as a part of each of my projects. You can view all of my work under the "Projects" tab.
