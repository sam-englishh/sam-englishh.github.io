Hi! My name is Sam and I am learning how to code with R and this is my first website! I am majoring in Economics and planning to minor in Data Science. I enjoy working with numbers and data to explain my reasoning and love learning about different ways to present data. Have a look at the data visualizations I made on my website :)
